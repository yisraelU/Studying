  - ISO-639 : Language code that represents a particular language 
  - This is broken down into parts such as ISO-639-3
  - There are 5 parts
    - Part 1 (ISO 639-1:2002) provides a 2 letter code that has been designed to represent most of the major languages of the world.
    - Part 2 (ISO 639-2:1998) provides a 3 letter code, which gives more possible combinations, so ISO 639-2:1998 can cover more languages.
    - Part 3 (ISO 639-3:2007) provides a 3 letter code and aims to give as complete a listing of languages as possible, including living, extinct and ancient languages.
    - Part 4 (ISO 639-4:2010) gives the general principles of language coding and lays down guidelines for the use of ISO 639.
    - Part 5 (ISO 639-5:2008) provides a 3 letter code for language families and groups (living and extinct).
